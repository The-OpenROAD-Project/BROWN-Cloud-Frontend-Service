## Purpose
[The OpenROAD Project](https://theopenroadproject.org/) aims at providing a 24-hour, no-human-in-the-loop layout design 
for SoC, package and PCB with no Power-Performance-Area (PPA) loss. The cloud infrastructure set up at 
[OpenROAD Cloud](https://cloud.theopenroadproject.org/) makes the tools and designs accessible through
an easy-to-use web-based interface.

If you want to jump start using our platform, go to the [Quickstart](#quickstart-guide) section.

## Deployment on a Private Cloud
Although the publicly available platform enables our research and offers ease-of-use and latest 
improvements to users around the world, OpenROAD flow can be independently deployed on a private 
cloud infrastructure.

In general, here are the skills and tracks you can contribute to:

decent skills in `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `JQuery`. 
Dare to modernize our frontend stack to `VueJS`, `Angular` or `React`? We would love to hear from you. 
- **Backend development**: Our REST APIs are built using `Python Django REST Framework`. 
In addition, there are some views rendered using `Django template system`. 
Contribute to this track if you are familiar with `Python`, `Djnago`, `REST APIs` and databases.
- **Testing**: writing unit tests, integration tests, and automating this process is at the heart of our
CI/CD pipeline. Contribute to this track to enhance the reliability of the platform.
